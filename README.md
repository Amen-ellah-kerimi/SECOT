### **Project Title: SECOT (Security for SEC and IoT for OT)**  

#### **Project Overview**  
SECOT is an **IoT security demonstration project** designed to highlight the critical importance of cybersecurity in IoT (Internet of Things) and OT (Operational Technology) environments. The project involves a **hands-on simulation of cyberattacks** on both secure and insecure IoT devices, emphasizing the consequences of poor security practices and demonstrating protective measures.  

#### **Key Components & Demonstration**  
1. **IoT Device Functionality:**  
   - A custom-built IoT device scans the local Wi-Fi network to **identify connected devices** (focusing on cameras for this demonstration).  
   - The device uses a **TFT display** to show a list of discovered devices.  
   - The user can **select a target device** and choose from a set of predefined attacks:  
     - **Denial-of-Service (DoS)**  
     - **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)**  
     - **Deauthentication (Deauth)**  

2. **Controlled Attack Simulation:**  
   - The demonstration compares attack outcomes on **secure vs. insecure IoT devices**.  
   - Highlights how **security measures** (encryption, secure coding, network hardening) mitigate or prevent attacks.  

3. **Educational Presentation:**  
   - Detailed **code comparison** between secure and vulnerable implementations.  
   - Explanation of **defensive techniques** (cryptography, authentication, secure protocols).  
   - Emphasis on **best practices** for IoT/OT security.  

#### **Ethical & Safety Considerations**  
- All attacks are performed in a **secure, isolated lab environment**.  
- Only **pre-approved, personally owned devices** are used as targets.  
- Supervised by **faculty members** (Cybersecurity & IoT professors, potentially a Network professor).  

#### **Project Goals**  
✅ Raise awareness about **IoT/OT security risks**.  
✅ Demonstrate **real-world attack scenarios** and their impact.  
✅ Teach **practical defensive strategies** for securing IoT systems.
